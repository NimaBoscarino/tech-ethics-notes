# Effects and Ethics of Technology

Content + Lesson plan for an Advanced Lecture on ethics of technology at Lighthouse Labs.

Note — this lecture is partly based off of content from the CMPT 320 course offered at SFU. However, none of the actual material from that course is actually reproduced here.

Also to note — this lecture relies on readings and videos that are protected by copyright, so I will not post that material here in its entirety. Instead I will quote short passages and provide citations for those who wish to do further reading.
