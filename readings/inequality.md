“Reducing workers to meat algorithms, useful only for their ability to move and follow orders, makes them easier to hire, fire, and abuse. Workers who go where their wrist-mounted terminal tells them to don’t even need to understand the local language, and they don’t need an education. Both of these factors, together with the atomisation produced by technological augmentation, also prevent effective organisation. Whether you’re a bone-tired, constantly moving picker on the Amazon shop floor getting your instructions from a Wi-Fi-enabled barcode scanner, or a late-night, individually contracted minicab driver following the bright line of a GPS system from red dot to red dot, the technology effectively precludes you from working with your colleagues for the advancement of working conditions. (This hasn’t stopped Uber, for example, from requiring that its drivers listen to a set number of anti-union podcasts every week, all controlled by their app, to drive the message home.)

Once the inside of a car or warehouse is organised in such an efficient manner, its effects start to spread outside as well. In the 1960s and ’70s, automobile makers in Japan created a system called just-in-time manufacturing: ordering small quantities of materials from suppliers at greater frequencies. This approach reduced their stock levels and smoothed out cash flows, simultaneously slimming down and speeding up production. But to stay competitive, their suppliers had to get faster too: in some factories, products were expected within two hours of being ordered. The result was that huge amounts of goods were effectively stored on trucks, ready to go at any time, and as close to the factories as possible. The car companies had simply passed the costs of storage and stock control back to their suppliers. In addition, whole new towns and service areas sprung up in the hinterlands of the factories to feed and water the waiting truckers, fundamentally altering the geographies of manufacturing towns. Companies are deploying these lessons, and their effects, at the level of individuals, passing costs onto their employees and demanding that they submit their bodies to the efficiencies of the machine.

In early 2017, several news agencies ran stories on Uber drivers sleeping in their cars. Some of them were catching a few hours of sleep between late-night bar closings and the morning rush hours; others simply had no home to go to. When the company was asked to comment, an Uber spokesman responded with a two-line statement: ‘With Uber people make their own decisions about when, where and how long to drive. We’re focused on making sure that driving with Uber is a rewarding experience, however you choose to work.’19 The idea of choice is key here, where it assumes that those who work for the company have such a choice. One driver explained how she had been assaulted by three intoxicated customers late one night in Los Angeles, but had been forced to return to work because her car was leased from Uber itself, and she was contractually obliged to keep up payments. (Her assailants were never apprehended.)”
